# Classification on BBC news datasets using NB, kNN, SVM andNNs

General Instruction:
Recall that we have covered a series of supervised learning approaches for classification in our
lectures, including Naïve Bayes, kNN, SVM, and Neural
Networks. The goal of this assignment is to investigate supervised learning
algorithms for article classification on BBC news datasets using NB, kNN, SVM and NNs. This
assignment can be divided into four parts. Please write a python program to complete the
following tasks using the Scikit-learn library:

● Task 1: Exploratory data analytics on text data

● Task 2: Perform classification models (NB, kNN, SVM, NNs) to build article
classifiers using the given dataset.

● Task 3: Investigate the impact of multiple hyperparameters. Compare the classification
quality across four classification models in terms of F1 measure. Learn to manage overfitting or underfitting situations.

● Task 4: Report your answers for each question and summarize your insights
